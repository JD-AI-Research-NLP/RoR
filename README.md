# RoR
This repo provides the code for reproducing the experiments in Findings-EMNLP 2021 paper: [RoR: Read-over-Read for Long Document Machine Reading Comprehension](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.160.pdf). This code is adapted from the repos of  [longformer](https://github.com/allenai/longformer).

## Environment
transformers==2.11.0 <br>
torch>=1.6.0 <br>
pytorch-lightning==1.2.0 <br>
test-tube==0.7.5 


## TriviaQA
We currently only open source the code in the TriviaQA dataset. To reproduce the results, you donâ€™t have to train any model and can use the pretrained [triviaqa-longformer-large](https://ai2-s2-research.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/longformer/triviaqa-longformer-large.tar.gz) to infer directly. The detailed inference steps are given in the inference.txt.
